GIAfem is a C++ library linked with the finite-element package MFEM for some common geophysical computations, specifically for GIA (glacier isostatic adjustment).

The core algorithms consist of the forward GIA computation and inverse GIA computation, the latter based on the adjoint method.

Steps to install and set up the project:
git clone https://github.com/Zih0770/GIAfem
cd GIAfem
